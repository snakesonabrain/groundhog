groundhog
~~~~~~

This Python package contains useful functionality for supporting automated geotechnical calculations.

Functionality for onshore and offshore geotechnical problems is included. This package is under constant development so any request for additional functionality can always be submitted to the package author.

groundhog bundles a large amount of knowledge and provides it to end users through extensively documented functions. The aim of the package is as follows:

   - Improve correctness through unit-tested functions with parameter validation
   - Raise awareness on underlying test data and theories supporting engineering correlations and design formulae
   - Promoting development of open-source engineering software by the worldwide community of engineers
